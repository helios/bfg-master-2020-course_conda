## Conda
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates **packages** and their dependencies.
2. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between **environments** on your local computer.

# Packages

## Packages
![](img/munch.png){width=300}

I am alone in an empty room and I want to paint "L'Urlo" by Munch.

----

What i need?

- Brushes
- Temperas
- Canvas
 
. . .

If you think the room where you are as the **computer** you are using, then the **Brushes**, **Temperas** and **Canvas** are the informatics tools you need to perform an operation. These informatics tools are distributed as **packages**.

. . .

> Basically a **package** refers to a compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular tool/application.

----

![](img/munch.png){width=100}

Thinking again to the painting, because you need some objects to make it, you could say it **depends** by those objects.

. . .

In other words the painting has some **dependencies**.

----

In the same way every application that you need to use in your computers has some **dependencies** and you need to install them before running the application.

. . .

Moreover, every **dependencies** would in turn has other dependencies and so on...

. . .

We satisfy **dependencies** by installing **packages**.

----

# Environments

## Environments
In the same way the **packages** are represented by the  tools needed to do the **painting**, the "room" in which they are collected, in your computer is called **enviroment**.

. . .

> Simplifying the concept, an **environment** is the collection of all the informatics tools/application/librarires/variables that you, or other software, could access on your computer.

----

Now imagine that you want to build a car.

![](img/bronco.png){width=600}

----

As seen before you will need new tools available in your room, such as:

1. screwdrivers
2. screws
3. wrenches

. . .

In other words to use a new software you often need to install new packages on your computer.

----

In your room you have **6 objects** and it is easy to find exactly what you need. 

. . .

After some times you are able to do all these things:
![](img/collage.png){}

. . .

- How many tools are inside the room?
- Is still easy to find and manage the tools you need?

----

In the same way when you install a lot of software in your computer a huge amount of packages are installed.

. . .

As a room full of abjects, the increasing complexity could create issues on your system. 

. . .

Any solutions for this?

----

Imagine to split out your room in many small rooms, and to put inside each of them only the tools you need to make a specific operation or to run a specific software.

. . .

In this way it will be simplier to manage and use the tools you need.

![](img/warehouse.png){width=500} ![](img/house.png){width=300} 

----

On your computer the multiple **rooms** are called **virtual environments**.

. . .

> A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated spaces for them that contain per-project dependencies for them.

# Conda (again)

## Conda (again)
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates **packages** and their dependencies.
2. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between **environments** on your local computer.

. . .

So conda is:

- a packages manager
- an environments manager

# Conda Installation

## Conda installation
1. Download the installer

. . .

https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual


2. Run the installer

. . .

```bash
bash Anaconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

4. Follow the prompts on the installer screens.

5. To make the changes take effect, close and then re-open your terminal window.

6. Test your installation running:

. . .

```bash
conda list
```

# Conda virtual environment

## Conda virtual environment
A conda virtual environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that you have installed. 

. . .

For example, you may have one virtual environment with NumPy 1.7 and its dependencies, and another virtual environment with NumPy 1.6 for legacy testing.

. . .

If you change one virtual environment, your other virtual environments are not affected. 

. . .

You can also share your virtual environment with someonene else.

----

When you begin using conda, you already have a default environment named **base**. You don't want to put programs into your base environment, though. Create separate virtual environments to keep your programs isolated from each other.

. . .

1. Create a new virtual environment called **snowflakes**.

. . .

```bash
conda create --name snowflakes
```

2. Activate your new virtual environment

. . .

```bash
conda activate snowflakes
```

3. Install a new packages called **BioPython** in the virtual environment

. . .

```bash
conda install biopython
```
----

4. Conda checks to see what additional packages ("dependencies") BioPython will need, and asks if you want to proceed:

. . .

```bash
Proceed ([y]/n)? 
y
```
----

To visualize the list of packages that are actually installed on the active envinronment:

```bash
conda list
echo
mv text.txt text.png
cat
```
. . .

You should see **BioPython**

. . .

To exit from the **snowflakes** virtual environment and return to your **base** environment type:


```bash
conda deactivate.
```

. . .

If you list again the installed packages you should **NOT** find any **ByoPython**

. . .

You could visualize all the virtual environments on your computer using:

```bash
conda env list
```

----

## Managing python
When you create a new environment, conda installs the same Python version you used when you downloaded and installed Anaconda.

If you want to use a different version of Python, for example Python 3.5, simply create a new environment and specify the version of Python that you want.

. . .

```bash
conda create --name snakes python=3.5
```
. . .

Activate it

```bash
conda activate snakes
```

----

Verify that the snakes environment has been added and is active:

```bash
conda env list
```
. . .

Verify the python version

```bash
python --version
```

Finally deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
conda deactivate
```

----

# Conda packages

## Conda packages
A conda package is a compressed tarball file (.tar.bz2) or .conda file that contains:

- system-level libraries
- Python or other modules
- executable programs and other components
- metadata under the directory
- a collection of files that are installed directly into an install prefix

----

1. To find a package you want to install, first activate the environmentin which you want to install it

. . .

```bash
conda activate snowflakes
```

2. Check to see if the package you want (**beautifulsoup4**) is available from the **Anaconda repository**

. . .

```bash
conda search beautifulsoup4
```

3. Install the package in the current environment

. . .

```bash
conda install beautifulsoup4
```

4. Check to see if the newly installed program is in this environment

```bash
conda list
```

# Conda channels

## Conda channels
Conda channels are the locations where packages are stored. They serve as the base for hosting and managing packages.

Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages.

. . .

The conda command searches a default set of channels, and packages are automatically downloaded and updated from **https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/**.

----

When you installed the packages **BioPython** or **beautifulsoup4** before, they were taken from Conda default channels.

```bash
conda install bipython
```
. . .

The same is true for searching a specific package

```bash
conda search beautifulsoup4
```
----

You can modify what remote channels are automatically searched.

. . .

**Conda-forge** is a community channel made up of thousands of contributors.

. . .

To search for the package **scipy** in **conda-forge**

```bash
conda search scipy --channel conda-forge
```
. . .

You may specify multiple channels by passing the argument multiple times

```bash
conda search scipy --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda
```

----

You can now open your **snowflake** environemnt and install **scipy** from **conda-forge**

. . .

```bash
conda activate snowflakes
```
```bash
conda install scipy --channel conda-forge
```
```bash
conda list
```
```bash
conda deactivate
```
