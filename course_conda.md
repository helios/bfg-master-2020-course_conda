## Conda
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates **packages** and their dependencies.
2. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between **environments** on your local computer.

# Packages

## Packages

I am alone in an empty room and I want to paint "L'Urlo" by Munch.

----

What i need?

- Brushes
- Temperas
- Canvas
 
. . .

If you think the room where you are as the **computer** you are using, then the **Brushes**, **Temperas** and **Canvas** are the informatics tools you need to perform an operation. They are distributed as **packages**

. . .

Basically a **package** refers to a compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular tool/application.

Thinking again to the painting, because you need some objects to make it, you could say it **depends** by those objects.

. . .

In other words the painting has some **dependencies**.

----

In the same way every application that you need to use in your computers has some **dependencies** and you need to install them before running the application.

. . .

Moreover, every **dependencies** would in turn has other dependencies and so on...

. . .

We satisfy **dependencies** by installing **packages**.

# Environments

## Environments
Now imagine that you want to build a car.

----

As seen before you will need new tools available in your room, such as:

1. screwdrivers
2. screws
3. wrenches

. . .

In other words to use a new software you often need to install new packages on your computer.
